# Plugins runtime

The plugins-runtime is the responsible on generate the api and to load the plugin.

Once you've run the example plugin or your own, you should see on the browser devtools the logs from this file `plugins-runtime/src/index.ts`. So every time there is a change in the page, file or selection in the penpot app, it'll show a log.

See [this doc about how installing plugins](../docs/create-plugin.md).
